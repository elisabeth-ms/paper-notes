## [Make It Happen](http://www.argmin.net/2018/01/29/taxonomy/)

The author motivates why RL is harder and more important than supervised and unsupervised learning.

### Key Points

- Here is an approximated taxonomy of ML:

- It turns out the field of Data Science has terminology for this trichotomy as well:
  - **Descriptive Analytics**: summarizing data in a way to make it more interpretable, similar to **Unsupervised Learning**.
  - **Predictive Analytics**: estimating outcomes from current data, similar to **Supervised Learning**.
  - **Prescriptive Analytics**: guiding actions to achieve the goal, similar to **Reinforcement Learning**.

- According to the figurer above, the author claims that 

  1. Unsupervised Searning is by far the easiest of the three types of ML problems because the stakes are low. There is no wrong answer for summarization.
  2. Supervised Learning is more challenging as we can evaluate accuracy in a principled manner on new data.
  3. RL is the hardest as it needs to deal with evolving environment and complicated feedback resulting from interaction.
  
- RL (prescriptive analytics) has the highest value among ML's trichotomy since it directly outputs actions with the promist that these actions will lead to valuable returns.
- RL is a great tool to conceptualize interaction in machine learning.

### My two cents

According to [1], 
`
prescriptive analytics leverages predictive analytics and descriptive analytics to derive ideal outcomes or solutions from helping you solve business problems
`

`
It takes predictive analytics further by helping you see what the probable outcome relies on each decision. That helps you to decide what business decision to make.
`

In addition to the 

Automated analytics requires safe ML system
